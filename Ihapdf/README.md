This project visualizes probability density functions (PDFs) for various datasets (JAM20/CJ15nlo) and variables(du/dv/uv). The heatmap dynamically represents the relationship between a normalized parameter and the corresponding pdf.

# Features

The heatmap visualizes the PDF of the selected dataset and variable.
